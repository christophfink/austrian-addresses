# Austrian addresses

This is code to periodically download all housenumbers in Austria from [Open
Street Map (OSM)](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Use_OpenStreetMap) and
compile a data set of [Voronoi
polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) that allows for simple
look-up queries for the closest address for any given point.
